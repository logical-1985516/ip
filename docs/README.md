# Luke User Guide

// Product screenshot goes here

Luke is a simple task list manager. You (the person on the right) can interact with Luke (the person on the left) through commands to manage your tasks. If this is your first time using this app, sample data has already been loaded for you. Feel free to experiment with them and delete them if not in use. Your tasks are automatically saved to the save file, which will be automatically loaded upon starting Luke.

Warning: do not edit the save file directly, or the save file may be corrupted! In this case, you might possibly lose all your saved tasks!

Below is the list of features/commands that are available:

## Basic functionality

To interact with Luke, you will type your input into the textbox provided, and hit "Enter" or the "Send" button. 

Inputs have to be valid for the feature to execute.

The first word in your input is called a `command`. If it does not match with one of these words (not case-sensitive): "todo", "deadline", "event", "list", "mark", "unmark", "find", "delete", "help", "bye", this error message would be displayed:

```
________________________________________________________
Sorry, please type a valid command. The valid commands are:
bye
list
mark
unmark
todo
deadline
event
delete
find
help
________________________________________________________
```

In general, error messages will be thrown if the input is invalid or the save file is corrupted, telling the user about the cause of error and what to do to rectify it.

## Adding todos

Adds a todo of the specified description, without a start or end date, to the task list.
